# TO-DO IndexedDB Web App

This a sample project, product of a series of tutorials made by myself on **DEV**. The aim is to teach/learn the basics of the IndexedDB API, specifically:

- Learn about the concepts of transactions, requests, object stores
- Learn how to perform **CRUD** operations in the IndexedDB instance

To install all the dependencies:
```
npm install
```

To start the local development server:
```
npm run start   
```
