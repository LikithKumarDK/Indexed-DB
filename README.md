This a sample project, product of a series of tutorials made by myself on **DEV**. The aim is to teach/learn the basics of the IndexedDB API, specifically:

- Learn about the concepts of transactions, requests, object stores
- Learn how to perform **CRUD** operations in the IndexedDB instance

You can read the blog [here](https://dev.to/devtony101/javascript-building-a-to-do-app-with-the-indexeddb-api-part-1-4382).

## Features

- **Create a task**: You can create a brand new task with a given title, description and deadline date. Later that task is saved using JavaScript IndexedDB API.
- **Show saved tasks**: Everytime the page loads it will query the indexed database to get all saved tasks and display them as panels at the bottom of the page.
- **Edit a task**: You can edit any given task at any given moment.
- **Toggle the "done" status of a task**: You can toggle whether a task is "done" via either a checkbox or while editing the task.
